# Princeton-algorithms

My exercises for the course *Algorithms* taught by Princeton University. Lecturers: [Robert Sedgewick][L1] and [Kevin Wayne][L2].

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
