Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

## Board

**Corner cases:**
You may assume that the constructor receives an n-by-n array containing the n2 integers between 0 and n2 âˆ’ 1, where 0 represents the blank square.

**Performance Requirement:**
Your implementation should support all Board methods in time proportional to n2 (or better) in the worst case.

## Solver 
To implement the A* algorithm, you must use MinPQ from algs4.jar for the priority queue(s).
